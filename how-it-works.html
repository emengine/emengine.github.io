<h2 class="bg-heading2">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Electro-magnetic converter of the electric power into thrust force (referred to here as EMC) provides a means to directly convert electrical power into thrust force, without use of any mediators, such as heated or ionized gasses, conductive rails, etc.
</p>
<p>
The operation of EMC is based on present theories of electromagnetism.
</p>


<h2 class="bg-heading2">Principle of work</h2>

<p>
In a system comprising of two conductive wire coils `A` and `B`, each carrying electric current of constant value `i_1` and `i_2`, there will be magnetic forces on both coils. These forces are a result of interaction between currents in each coil and magnetic field produced by those currents. In this static case, force on coil `A` (`vec F_ba`) will be equal, but opposite, to the force on coil `B` (`vec F_ab`).
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig01.png" alt="Figure 01."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 01.</p>

<p>
However, when currents in these coils are changing over time, forces `vec F_ba` and `vec F_ab` will not be equal in value, due to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>force on an electric current element (i.e. a wire) is a result of interaction between the current flowing through the element and a magnetic field that the element interacts with
</li>
<li>
any change in a magnetic field in vacuum propagates at the speed of light
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on these two assumptions, it is possible to achieve a stationary state where currents `i_1` and `i_2` are changing in a way that produces consistent difference between forces `vec F_ba` and `vec F_ab`, a resultant force `F_r`, where that resultant force has constant value, not equal to zero, and direction. This generates a constant thrust on the system made of wire coils `A` and `B` as a result of a tendency of the system to move relative to the generated magnetic field.
</p>

<h3 class="bg-heading2">Very simple model for illustration</h3>
<p>
In order to better explain the basics of EMC operation, let's take a look at a very simple model of operation.
</p>
<p>
In this model we have two coils, `A` and `B`, each carrying a constant electric current `i`. Magnetic field generated by coil `A` will create a magnetic force `vec F_ab` on coil `B`. Same goes for coil `B`: magnetic field generated by it will create a magnetic force `vec F_ba` on coil `A`.
</p>
<p>
These two forces are equal in value but opposite in direction and their sum, the net force `vec F_r = vec F_ab + vec F_ba`, will be equal to `0`.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig01a.png" alt="Figure 01a."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 01a.</p>

<p>
Let's observe what happens if we <em>instantly</em> turn off electric current in coil `A`. This is not practically possible, but in order to better illustrate the main point of EMC operation, let's assume we can do that.
</p>
<p>
At the moment electric current in coil `A` drops to `0`, magnetic force `vec F_ba` drops to `0` too, since the current is gone. However, and this is the key part, force `F_ab` will not become equal to `0` yet. The reason for this is that the magnetic force is a result of interaction between electric current running in coil `B` and magnetic field, produced by coil `A`, at the location of coil `B`.
</p>
<p>
Instant drop of current in coil `A` to `0` will cause it's magnetic field to drop to `0`, but this change will not immediately propagate to the location where coil `B` is. It will take very small, but finite amount of time for magnetic field at the location of coil `B` to also drop to `0`. This amount of time equals to distance between the coils divided by speed of light in vaccum.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig01b.png" alt="Figure 01b."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 01b.</p>

<p>
Only at the moment when magnetic field at the location of coil `B` drops to `0` will force `vec F_ab` become `0` and we will again have `F_ab = F_ba` and net force `F_r = 0`.
</p>
<p>
However, during that tiny fraction of time needed for the change of magnetic field to propagate from coil `A` to coil `B`, forces `F_ab` and `F_ba` will not be equal and their sum will be `!= 0`.
</p>
<p>
This is the key point that EMC operation is based on.
</p>
<p>
It is not possible to instantly turn off an electric current in a coil, but it is possible to change the current in one way or another. And any change in current changes magnetic field produced by it and those changes propagate through space at the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
Let's see what we can come up with based on those facts.
</p>

<h2 class="bg-heading2">Qualitative description of work</h2>

<p>
We will use two conductive wire coils, `A` and `B`, placed and aligned co-axially at a distance `x_0`. Each of wire coils is made of one turn of conductive wire. Each carries electric current, current `i_1` in coil `A` and `i_2` in coil `B`.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig02.png" alt="Figure 02."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 02.</p>

<p>
As a result of electric currents flow, there will be magnetic field generated by these two coils. Strength of the magnetic field produced by an electric current is directly proportional to the electric current strength. Magnetic force on a wire coil is directly proportional to the electric current strength carried by that wire coil, and a magnetic field strength produced by the electric current carried by the other coil. We will designate these forces on wire coils with `F_12` and `F_21`.
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12` - magnetic force on current `i_2` produced by magnetic field generated by current `i_1`
<br/>
`F_21` - magnetic force on current `i_1` produced by magnetic field generated by current `i_2`
</div>

<p>
These forces have values:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = K * i_2 * i_1`
<br/>
`F_21 = K * i_1 * i_2`
</div>

<p>
where `K` is coefficient which depends on the geometry of the system and is constant over time.
</p>
<p>
In the simple system we have set up, these two forces will be colinear with the `x` axis.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig03.png" alt="Figure 03."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 03.</p>

<p>
Resultant force on the entire system is:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`vec F_r = vec F_12 + vec F_21`
</div>

<p>
and since `vec F_12` and `vec F_21` are co-linear we can simply use:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_r = F_12 + F_21`
</div>


<h3 class="bg-heading3">Simple case of non-constant currents</h3>
<p>
If we start chaging current `i_1` and/or `i_2` strength, forces `F_12` and `F_21` will change over time. We will annotate previous formulas to account for this fact like so:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12(t) = K * i_2(t) * i_1(t)`
<br/>
`F_21(t) = K * i_1(t) * i_2(t)`
<br/>
`F_r(t) = F_12(t) + F_21(t)`
</div>
<p>
In order to illustrate principle of EMC operation, we will observe a simple case where current `i_1` is constant and current `i_2` increasing in linear fashion.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig04.png" alt="Figure 04."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 04.</p>

<p>
In the moment `t_1`, we would have:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12(t_1) = K * i_2(t_1) * i_1(t_1)`
<br/>
`F_21(t_1) = K * i_1(t_1) * i_2(t_1)`
<br/>
<br/>
`F_r(t_1) = F_12(t_1) + F_21(t_1)`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`= K * i_2(t_1) * i_1(t_1) - K * i_1(t_1) * i_2(t_1) = 0`
</div>

<p>
Here we come to the key points for EMC operation. First point is: forces `F_21` and `F_12` are a result of interaction between electric current and magnetic field, and not a result of interaction with another electric current. And the second one: changes in magnetic field in vacuum propagate at the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
This effectively means that, as electric current `i_2` steadily rises, force `F_12` on coil `B` will be proportional to value of the `i_2` in moment `t_1` and to the value of `i_1`.
</p>
<p>
However, force `F_21` on coil `A` will be proportional to the value of `i_1` in moment `t_1` and the value of `i_2` in moment `t_0`. Reason for this is that, in moment `t_1`, current `i_1` interacts with the magnetic field produced by `i_2` in `t_0`. Difference `Delta t = t_1 - t_0` is equal to the time that is needed for change in magnetic field to propagate from coil `B` to coil `A` and is equal to `x_0 / c`, where `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.
</p>
<p>
This means that forces `F_12` and `F_21` in moment `t_1` are equal to:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12(t_1) = K * i_2(t_1) * i_1(t_1)`
<br/>
`F_21(t_1) = K * i_1(t_1) * i_2(t_0)`
<br/>
<br/>
`F_r(t_1) = F_12(t_1) + F_21(t_1)`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`= K * i_2(t_1) * i_1(t_1) - K * i_1(t_1) * i_2(t_0)`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`= K * i_1(t_1) * ( i_2(t_1) - i_2(t_0) ) != 0`
</div>

<p>
Here it turns out that the resultant force is not equal to zero, since current `i_2` changes and `i_2(t_1) != i_2(t_0)`.
</p>
<p>
If current `i_2` rises, net force will be negative, which in this setup means it will be directed along `x` axis, right-to-left.
</p>
<p>
<div class="well">
<small>
<em>NOTE:</em><br/>
Even though `i_2(t_1) > i_2(t_0)`, the force will be negative because coefficient `K` is actually negative. We choose to do so just to avoid dragging the minus sign through all the equations.
</small>
</div>
</p>

<h3 class="bg-heading3">Constant net force for the simple case of non-constant currents</h3>
<p>
Goal here is to have EMC produce a net force, if not constant, then at least directed in the same direction at all times during operation.
</p>
<p>
It turns out this is fairly simple to achieve by using the following wave forms for currents `i_1` and `i_2`:
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig05.png" alt="Figure 05."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 05.</p>

<p>
The wave forms are divided into 8 segments in such a way that for each segment only one of the currents is linearly changing while the other one is constant. Crossing zero point and changing sign means that an electric current is changing direction in the conductive wire coil.
</p>
<p>
By using the same reasoning from previous section (which corresponds to the case in segment 1) and taking into account when electric currents are positive and when they're negative, it is easy to conclude that the net force `F_r` is always negative and constant in value, which means it is always directed from right to left on our diagram in Figure 03.
</p>
<p>
Detailed analysis will not be given here since it is simple repetiton of reasoning from previous section, making sure to take into account when electric currents are positive/negative and a fact that in some segments `i_1` is constant (positive or negative) and `i_2` is changing (rising or falling, which makes `i_2(t_1) - i_2(t_0)` positive or negative) and in others it is the other way around.
</p>
<p>
Forces `F_12` and `F_21` are changing directions as currents change from positive to negative and back, but the net result stays negative and constant.
</p>


<h2 class="bg-heading2">Getting quantitative estimate of the net force</h2>
<p>
It is fairly obvious that Figure 05 resembles two sine waves shifted by 90 degrees. For that reason, we will assume that currents `i_1` and `i_2` change as a sine wave functions:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`i_1 = i_1 * cos omega t`
<br/>
`i_2 = i_2 * sin omega t`
<br/>
`omega = 2 * pi * f`
<br/>
<br/>
`f` - frequency of the sine wave
</div>

<p>
In order to come up with quantitative estimate of the net force, we will again work with two wire coils, `A` and `B`, placed co-axially along `x`-axis. We will also place coil `A` to be at the `x`-axis zero point and coil `B` at the distance `x_0`. Each coil will have only one turn of conductive wire. Coil `A` will carry electrical current `i_1` and coil `B` current `i_2`.
</p>

<p class="text-center">Figure 06.</p>


<h3 class="bg-heading3">Calculus</h3>

<h4 class="bg-heading4">Calculus setup</h4>
<p>
We will use the formula of calculating a magnetic force on a wire coil via magnetic flux:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F = i * d/dx Phi`
</div>
<p>
where:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i` - intensity of electrical current in a wire coil
<br/>
`d/dx Phi` - rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. In this case we are interested only with rate of change by `x`-axis
</div>
<p>
For our two coils we will have:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = i_2 * d/dx Phi_12`
<br/>
`F_21 = i_1 * d/dx Phi_21`
</div>
<p>
and
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_r = F_12 + F_21`
</div>
<p>
Electrical currents `i_1` and `i_2` will be:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i_1 = i_1 * cos omega t`
<br/>
`i_2 = i_2 * sin omega t`
</div>
<p>
Magnetic flux through the coil will be:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`Phi = M * i`
</div>
<p>
where
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i` - electrical current through the coil
<br/>
`M` - mutual inductance between two coils. This value depends on coil geometry only.
</div>
<p>
Using mutual inductance, magnetic forces become:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = i_2 * d/dx ( M_12 * i_1 )`
<br/>
`F_21 = i_1 * d/dx ( M_21 * i_2 )`
</div>
<p>
Since electrical currents don't vary with respect to value of `x` (distance between coils), and `M_12 = M_21`, we'll have:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = i_2 * i_1 * d/dx M`
<br/>
`F_21 = i_1 * i_2 * d/dx M`
</div>
<p>
These two forces are equal for static case, when currents are constant, and are strictly not equal for general case, when currents are changing.
</p>
<p>
In order to estimate net force value, we will have to take into account the facts that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
currents are changing in time
</li>
<li>
there is a phase shift between electrical current value in moment `t` in one coil and magnetic flux produced by that current in the other coil
</li>
</ul><p>
This phase shift comes from the finite speed of flux change propagation through space and is one of the key points for EMC operation.
</p>
<p>
Electrical currents in coils are dependent on time like so:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i_1 = i_1 * cos omega t`
<br/>
`i_2 = i_2 * sin omega t`
</div>
<p>
The phase shift we need to introduce depends on distance between two coils, on their position on `x`-axis:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i_1 = i_1 * cos ( omega t - k * x )`
<br/>
`i_2 = i_2 * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x_0 ) )`
</div>
<p>
where:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`k` - the wave number: `2 * pi / lambda`, <br/>`lambda =` wave length
</div>
<p>
For `i_1` we will have negative phase shift ( `- k * x` ) since coil `A` is to the left of the coil `B`.
</p>
<p>
For `i_2` we will have positive phase shift ( `+ k * x` ) since coil `B` is to the right of the coil `A`.
</p>
<p>
`i_2` also has position of the coil `B` on `x`-axis factored in and the phase shift becomes: `+ k * ( x - x_0 )`.
</p>
<p>
Taking all this into account, magnetic flux for coils becomes:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`Phi_12 = M(x) * i_1 * cos ( omega t - k * x )`
<br/>
`Phi_21 = M(x-x_0) * i_2 * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x_0 ) )`
</div>

<h4 class="bg-heading4">Putting it all together</h4>

<p>
Since we will need derivative of `M(x)` in order to get the final formula for net force, let's take a look at how `M(x)` function looks like in general case:
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig07.png" alt="Figure 07."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 07.</p>

<p>
First derivative `d/dx M(x)` would then look like this:
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/fig08.png" alt="Figure 08."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 08.</p>

<p>
It is important to note here that:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`M(x) = M(-x)`
</div>
<p>
and
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx M(-x) = - d/dx M(x)`
</div>
<p>
First derivatives of `Phi` by `x` will be:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx Phi_12 = i_1 * ( d/dx M(x) * cos ( omega t - k * x ) + M(x) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x ) ) )`
</div>
<p>
and
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx Phi_21 = i_2 * ( d/dx M(x-x_0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x_0 ) ) + M(x-x_0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( x - x_0 ) ) )`
</div>

<p>
Since we are calculating flux `Phi_12` through coil `B`, `x` will be equal to `x_0`:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx Phi_12 = i_1 * ( d/dx M(x_0) * cos ( omega t - k * x_0 ) + M(x_0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x_0 ) ) )`
</div>
<p>
For coil `A`, `x` will be equal to `0`:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx Phi_21 = i_2 * ( d/dx M(-x_0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) + M(-x_0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) )`
</div>
<p>
Taking into account that:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`M(x) = M(-x)`
<br/>
`d/dx M(-x) = - d/dx M(x)`
</div>
<p>
these two become:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`d/dx Phi_12 = i_1 * ( d/dx M(x_0) * cos ( omega t - k * x_0 ) + M(x_0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x_0 ) ) )`
<br/>
`d/dx Phi_21 = i_2 * ( - d/dx M(x_0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) + M(x_0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) )`
</div>

<h4 class="bg-heading4">The net force</h4>
<p>
Magnetic force on a coil is:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F = i * d/dx Phi`
</div>
<p>
Using our resutls for `d/dx Phi` from previous section we get:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = i_2 * d/dx Phi_12`
<br/>
`F_21 = i_1 * d/dx Phi_21`
</div>
<p>
Substituting for `i` and `d/dx Phi` we have:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_12 = i_2 * sin ( omega t ) * i_1 * ( d/dx M(x_0) * cos ( omega t - k * x_0 ) + M(x_0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x_0 ) ) )`
<br/>
`F_21 = i_1 * cos ( omega t ) * i_2 * ( - d/dx M(x_0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) + M(x_0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x_0 ) ) )`
</div>
<p>
Adding those two together and executing basic trigonometric transformations we get
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`F_r = F_12 + F_21 = i_1 * i_2 * ( d/dx M(x_0) * sin (k * x_0) + M(x_0) * k * cos (k * x_0) )`
</div>
<p>
This expression shows that net force is not equal to 0.
</p>
<p>
In order to evaluate the net force, we will simplify the expression. Let's assume that:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`x_0` &#x226A; `lambda`
</div>
<p>
in which case we can assume:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`sin ( k * x_0 ) ~~ k * x_0`
<br/>
`cos ( k * x_0 ) ~~ 1`
</div>
<p>
and since it is:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`k = 2 * pi / lambda`
</div>
<p>
then, for the case when distance between the two coils is much smaller than the wavelength, we will have:
</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_r ~~ i_1 * i_2 * 2 * pi / lambda * ( d/dx M(x_0) * x_0 + M(x_0) )`
</div>

<p>
Having in mind that for positive `x_0` (it can't be negative, it is a physical distance between the two coils), `d/dx M(x_0) * x_0` is negative and `M(x_0)` is positive, we can see that for some specific geometry of coils (diameter and distance) `d/dx M(x_0) * x_0 + M(x_0)` can be maximized or even made to be equal to `0`.
</p>

<h4 class="bg-heading4">Estimating net force</h4>

<p>
To estimate the net force, we will assume:
</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
`i_1 = i_2 = 1 A`
<br/>
`lambda = 1 m` (corresponds to ~300MHz frequency)
<br/>
`x_0 = 1 cm`
<br/>
`M = 1 mu H`
<br/>
`d/dx M(x_0) * x_0 ~~ 0`
</div>

<p>In this case we have net force to be:</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
`F_r ~~ 1 * 1 * 2 * pi / 1 * 10^-6 ~~ 6.28 mu N`
</div>

<p>
We can say that, in general, the net force is about million times smaller than the product of maximum current values in both coils.
</p>
<p>
Using finite element analysis we can calculate net force on arbitraty coil geometries and, in general case, above estimate turns out to be satisfactory.
</p>

<h2 class="bg-heading2">Conclusion(s)</h2>
<p>
Since the net force produced by EMC is practically negligible, pondering further on EMC characteristics would be practically un-practical. However, since it provides loads of fun for the nerds and other similar Earthly creatures, I did it anyways.
</p>
<p>
It turns out, among other things, that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enormous electrical power is required to produce thrust of any practical value
</li>
<li>
Frequencies of electrical currents in both coils have to be exactly the same, otherwise net force would oscillate and change direction with frequency equal to the difference between `i_1` and `i_2` current frequencies. This means both coils have to be powered from the same generator
</li>
<li>
Maximum thrust is achieved when `i_1` and `i_2` have 90 degree phase shift. To reverse thrust, all we have to do is change the phase shift for 180 degrees (to -90 or +270 electrical degrees)
</li>
<li>
Coils don't have to be miniature or very small compared to the wavelength. Calculating net force in that case requires FEA numerical calculations
</li>
<li>
In order to produce sinusoidal electric current in the coils, one can use square wave drive voltage, which means coils can be powered through some variant of switched mode power supply
</li>
</ul>

There were quite a bit more points and notes and thingies, but I'm just too lazy to retype them all here...
