<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Electro-magnetic converter of the electric power into thrust force (referred to here as EMC) provides a means to directly convert electrical power into thrust force, without use of any mediators, such as heated or ionized gasses, conductive rails, etc.
</p>
<p>
The operation of EMC is based on present theories of electromagnetism.
</p>


<h2>Principle of work</h2>

<p>
In a system comprising of two conductive wire coils A and B, each carrying electric current of constant value i1 and i2, there will be magnetic forces on both coils as a result of interaction between currents in each coil and magnetic field produced by those currents. In this static case, force on coil A (Fba) will be equal, but opposite, to the force on coil B (Fab).
</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="figures/F01.png" alt="Figure 01."> 
<p class="text-center">Figure 01.</p>

<p>
However, when currents in these coils are changing over time, forces Fba and Fab will not be equal in value, due to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>force on an electric current element (i.e. a wire) is a result of interaction between the current flowing through the element and a magnetic field that the element interacts with
</li>
<li>
any change in a magnetic field in vacuum propagates at the speed of light
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on these two assumptions, it is possible to achieve a stationary state where currents i1 and i2 are changing in a way that produces consistent difference between forces Fba and Fab, a resultant force, where that resultant force has constant value, not equal to zero, and direction. This generates a constant thrust on the system made of wire coils A and B as a result of a tendency of the system to move relative to generated magnetic field.
</p>

<h2>Qualitative description of work</h2>

<p>
This section describes EMC operation in qualitative terms, using exaggerated values in order to better illustrate details of the work.
</p>
<p>
We will use two conductive wire coils, A and B, placed and aligned co-axially at a distance x. Each of wire coils is made of one turn of conductive wire. Each carries electric current, current i1 in coil A and i2 in coil B.
</p>
[Fig. 02]

<p>
As a result of electric currents flow, there will be magnetic field generated by these two coils. Strength of the magnetic field produced by an electric current is directly proportional to the electric current strength. Magnetic force on a wire coil is directly proportional to the electric current strength carried by that wire coil, and a magnetic field strength produced by the electric current carried by the other coil. We will designate these forces on wire coils with F12 and F21.
</p>

<pre>
F12 - magnetic force on current i2 produced by magnetic field generated by current i1
F21 - magnetic force on current i1 produced by magnetic field generated by current i2
</pre>

<p>
These forces have values:
</p>

<pre>
F12 = k * i2 * i1
F21 = k * i1 * i2
</pre>

<p>
where k is coefficient which depends on the geometry of the system and is constant over time.
</p>
<p>
In the simple system we have set up, these two forces will be colinear with the x axis.
</p>

[Fig. 03]

<p>
Resultant force on the entire system is:
</p>

<pre>
Fr = F12 + F21
</pre>

<h3>Simple case of non-constant currents</h3>
<p>
If we start chaging current i1 and/or i2 strength, forces F12 and F21 will change over time. We will annotate previous formulas to account for this fact like so:
</p>
<pre>
F12(t) = k * i2(t) * i1(t)
F21(t) = k * i1(t) * i2(t)
Fr(t) = F12(t) + F21(t)
</pre>
<p>
In order to illustrate principle of EMC operation, we will observe a simple case where current i1 is constant and current i2 increasing in linear fashion.
</p>

[Fig. 04]

<p>
In the moment t1, we would have:
</p>
<pre>
F12(t1) = k * i2(t1) * i1(t1)
F21(t1) = k * i1(t1) * i2(t1)
Fr(t1) = F12(t1) + F21(t1) = k * i2(t1) * i1(t1) - k * i1(t1) * i2(t1) = 0
</pre>
<p>
Here we come to the key points for EMC operation. First point is: forces F21 and F12 are a result of interaction between electric current and a magnetic field, and not a result of interaction with another electric current. And the second: changes in magnetic field in vacuum propagate at the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
This effectively means that, as electric current i2 steadily rises, force F12 on coil B will be proportional to value of the i2 in moment t1 and the value of i1.
</p>
<p>
However, force F21 on coil A will be proportional to the value of i1 in moment t1 and the value of i2 in moment t0. Reason for this is that, in moment t1, current i1 interacts with the magnetic field produced by i2 in t0. Difference dt = t1 - t0 is equal to time that is needed for change in magnetic field to propagate from coil B to coil A and is equal to dx / c, where c is speed of light in vacuum.
</p>
<p>
This means that forces F12 and F21 in moment t1 are equal to:
</p>
<pre>
F12(t1) = k * i2(t1) * i1(t1)
F21(t1) = k * i1(t1) * i2(t0)
Fr(t1) = F12(t1) + F21(t1) = k * i2(t1) * i1(t1) - k * i1(t1) * i2(t0) = k * i1(t1) * ( i2(t1) - i2(t0) ) != 0
</pre>
<p>
Here it turns out that the resultant force is not equal to zero, since current i2 changes and i2(t1) != i2(t0).
</p>
<p>
If current i2 rises net force will be positive, which in this setup means it will be directed along x axis, left-to-right.
</p>

<h3>Constant net force for the simple case of non-constant currents</h3>
<p>
Goal here is to have EMC produce a net force, if not constant, then at least directed in the same direction during operation.
</p>
<p>
It turns out this is fairly simple to achieve by using the following wave forms for currents i1 and i2:
</p>

[Fig 05]
<p>
The wave forms are divided into 8 segments in such a way that for each segment only one of the currents is linearly changing while the other one is constant. Crossing zero point and changing sign means that an electric current is changing direction in the conductive wire coil.
</p>
<p>
By using same reasoning from previous section and taking into account when electric currents are positive and when they're negative, it is easy to conclude that the net force Fr is always positive and constant in value, which means it is always directed from left to right on our diagram in Figure 03.
</p>
<p>
Detailed analysis will not be given here since it is simple repetiton of reasoning from previous section, making sure to take into account when electric currents are positive/negative and a fact that in some segments i1 is constant (positive or negative) and i2 is changing (rising or falling, which makes i2(t1) - i2(t0) positive or negative) and in others it is the other way around.
</p>
<p>
Forces F12 and F21 are changing directions as currents change from positive to negative and back, but the net result stays positive and constant.
</p>


<h2>Getting quantitative estimate of the net force</h2>
<p>
It is fairly obvious that Figure 05 resembles two sine waves shifted by 90 degrees. For that reason, we will assume that currents i1 and i2 change as a sine wave functions:
</p>

<pre>
i1 = I1 * cos omega t
i2 = I2 * sin omega t
omega = 2 * pi * f

f - frequency of the sine wave
</pre>
<p>
In order to come up with quantitative estimate of the net force, we will again work with two wire coils, A and B, placed co-axially along X-axis. We will also place coil A to be at the X-axis zero point and coil B at the distance x0. Each coil will have only one turn of conductive wire. Coil A will carry electrical current i1 and coil B current i2.
</p>

[Fig. 06]


<h3>Calculus</h3>

<h4>Calculus setup</h4>
<p>
We will use formula of calculatin magnetic force on a wire coil via magnetic flux:
</p>
<pre>
F = i * d/dx PHI
</pre>
<p>
where:
</p>
<pre>
i - intensity of electrical current in a wire coil
dPHI / dx - rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. In this case we are interested only with rate of change by x-axis
</pre>
<p>
For our two coils we will have:
</p>
<pre>
F12 = i2 * d/dx PHI12
F21 = i1 * d/dx PHI21
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>

<pre>
Fr = F12 + F21
</pre>
<p>
Electrical currents i1 and i2 will be:
</p>
<pre>
i1 = I1 * cos omega t
i2 = I2 * sin omega t
</pre>
<p>
Magnetic flux through the coil will be:
</p>
<pre>
PHI = M * i
</pre>
<p>
where
</p>
<pre>
i - electrical current through the coil
M - mutual inductance between two coils. This value depends on coil geometry only.
</pre>
<p>
Using mutual inductance, magnetic forces become:
</p>
<pre>
F12 = i2 * d/dx ( M12 * i1 )
F21 = i1 * d/dx ( M21 * i2 )
</pre>
<p>
Since electrical currents don't vary with respect to value of x (distance between coils), and M12 = M21, we'll have:
</p>
<pre>
F12 = i2 * i1 * d/dx M
F21 = i1 * i2 * d/dx M
</pre>
<p>
These two forces are equal for static case, when currents are constant, and are strictly not equal for general case, when currents are changing.
</p>
<p>
In order to estimate net force value, we will have to take into account the facts that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
currents are changing in time
</li>
<li>
there is a phase shift between electrical current value in moment t in one coil and magnetic flux produced by that current in the other coil
</li>
</ul><p>
This phase shift comes from the finite speed of flux change propagation through space and is one of the key points for EMC operation.
</p>
<p>
Electrical currents in coils are dependent on time like so:
</p>
<pre>
i1 = I1 * cos omega t
i2 = I2 * sin omega t
</pre>
<p>
The phase shift we need to introduce depends on distance between two coils, on their position on x-axis:
</p>
<pre>
i1 = I1 * cos ( omega t - k * x )
i2 = I2 * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x0 ) )
</pre>
<p>
where:
</p>
<pre>
k - the wave number: 2 * pi / lambda, lambda = wave length
</pre>
<p>
For i1 we will have negative phase shift ( - k * x ) since coil A is to the left of the coil B.
</p>
<p>
For i2 we will have positive phase shift ( + k * x ) since coil B is to the right of the coil A.
</p>
<p>
i2 also has position of the coil B on x-axis factored in and the phase shift becomes: + k * ( x - x0 ).
</p>
<p>
Taking all this into account, magnetic flux for coils becomes:
</p>
<pre>
PHI12 = M(x) * I1 * cos ( omega t - k * x )
PHI21 = M(x-x0) * I2 * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x0 ) )
</pre>

<h4>Putting it all together</h4>

<p>
Since we will need derivative of M(x) in order to get final formula for net force, let's take a look at how M(x) function looks like in general case:
</p>

[Fig. 07]

<p>
First derivative d/dx M(x) would then look like this:
</p>

[Fig. 08]

<p>
It is important to note here that:
</p>
<pre>
M(x) = M(-x)
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre>
d/dx M(-x) = - d/dx M(x)
</pre>
<p>
First derivatives of PHI by x will be:
</p>
<pre>
d/dx PHI12 = I1 * ( d/dx M(x) * cos ( omega t - k * x ) + M(x) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x ) ) )
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre>
d/dx PHI21 = I2 * ( d/dx M(x-x0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( x - x0 ) ) + M(x-x0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( x - x0 ) ) )
</pre>

<p>
Since we are calculating flux PHI12 through coil B, x will be equal to x0:
</p>
<pre>
d/dx PHI12 = I1 * ( d/dx M(x0) * cos ( omega t - k * x0 ) + M(x0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x0 ) ) )
</pre>
<p>
For coil A, x will be equal to 0:
</p>
<pre>
d/dx PHI21 = I2 * ( d/dx M(-x0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) + M(-x0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) )
</pre>
<p>
Taking into account that:
</p>
<pre>
M(x) = M(-x)
d/dx M(-x) = - d/dx M(x)
</pre>
<p>
these two become:
</p>
<pre>
d/dx PHI12 = I1 * ( d/dx M(x0) * cos ( omega t - k * x0 ) + M(x0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x0 ) ) )
d/dx PHI21 = I2 * ( - d/dx M(x0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) + M(x0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) )
</pre>

<h4>The net force</h4>
<p>
Magnetic force on a coil is:
</p>
<pre>
F = i * d/dx PHI
</pre>
<p>
Using our resutls for d/dx PHI from previous section we get:
</p>
<pre>
F12 = i2 * d/dx PHI12
F21 = i1 * d/dx PHI21
</pre>
<p>
Substituting for i and d/dx PHI we have:
</p>
<pre>
F12 = I2 * sin ( omega t ) * I1 * ( d/dx M(x0) * cos ( omega t - k * x0 ) + M(x0) * (-k) * ( - sin ( omega t - k * x0 ) ) )
F21 = I1 * cos ( omega t ) * I2 * ( - d/dx M(x0) * sin ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) + M(x0) * k * cos ( omega t + k * ( - x0 ) ) )
</pre>
<p>
Adding those two together and executing basic trigonometric transformations we get
</p>
<pre>
Fr = F12 + F21 = I1 * I2 * ( d/dx M(x0) * sin (k * x0) + M(x0) * k * cos (k * x0) )
</pre>
<p>
This expression shows that net force is not equal to 0.
</p>
<p>
In order to evaluate the net force, we will simplify the expression. Let's assume that:
</p>
<pre>
x0 << lambda
</pre>
<p>
in which case we can assume:
</p>
<pre>
sin ( k * x0 ) ~~ k * x0
cos ( k * x0 ) ~~ 1
</pre>
<p>
and since
</p>
<pre>
k = 2 * pi / lambda
</pre>
<p>
for the case when distance between the two coils is much smaller than the wavelength, we have:
</p>

<pre>
Fr ~~ I1 * I2 * 2 * pi / lambda * ( d/dx M(x0) * x0 + M(x0) )
</pre>

<p>
Having in mind that for positive x0 (it can't be negative, it is a physical distance between the two coils), d/dx M(x0) * x0 is negative and M(x0) is positive, we can see that for some specific geometry of coils (diameter and distance) d/dx M(x0) * x0 + M(x0) can be maximized or even made to be equal to 0.
</p>

<h4>Estimating net force</h4>

<p>
To estimate the net force, we will assume:
</p>
<pre>
I1 = I2 = 1 A
lambda = 1 m (corresponds to ~300MHz frequency)
x0 = 1 cm
M = 1 uH
d/dx M(x0) * x0 = negligible
</pre>

<p>In this case we have net force to be:</p>

<pre>
Fr ~~ 1 * 1 * 2 * pi / 1 * 1e-6 ~~ 6.28 uN
</pre>

<p>
We can say that, in general, the net force is about million times smaller than the product of maximum current values in both coils.
</p>
<p>
Using finite element analysis we can calculate net force on arbitraty coil geometries and, in general case, above estimate turns out to be correct.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion(s)</h2>
<p>
Since the net force produced by EMC is practically negligible, pondering further on EMC characteristics would be a not practical thing to do. However, since it provides loads of fun for the nerds and other similar Earthly creatures, we'll do it anyways.
</p>
<p>
Going into further analysis of EMC work it turns out that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enormous electrical power is required to produce thrust of any practical value
</li>
<li>
Frequencies of electrical currents in both coils have to be exactly the same, otherwise net force would oscillate and change direction with frequency equal to difference between i1 and i2 current frequencies. This means both coils have to be powered from the same generator
</li>
<li>
Maximum thrust is achieved when i1 and i2 have 90 degree phase shift. To reverse thrust, all we have to do is change the phase shift for 180 degrees
</li>
<li>
Coils don't have to be miniature or very small compared to the wavelength. Calculating net force in that case requires FEA numerical calculations
</li>
<li>
In order to produce sinusoidal electric current in the coils, one can use square wave voltage which means coils can be powered through some variant of switched mode power supply
</li>
</ul>
