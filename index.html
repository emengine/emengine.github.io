Is it really true? Does it really work? Is it possible or is it just a weird anomaly?
</p>
<p>
The EM Drive, the EM Engine, the weird thingy that you plug into electric outlet and it starts hovering above ground emitting slight buzz and faint light?
</p>
<p>
I have no idea if that thing was or is possible, but what I do know is that it was summer, we had no electricity, you had to walk 20 minutes to get to the nearest place where you could get water, and you couldn't get out of the town just like that. Sarajevo, Bosnia, 1994.
</p>
<p>
Having no electricity at the time had an interesting side effects: no TV, no radio (except very occasionally), no computers (the old ones). We were hanging outside, in front of the building or in the hallways and in basemants. Besides spending a lot of time with neighbours and people you would never get to know during our "normal" life, we exchanged and read a lot of books, magazines and comics. A lot.
</p>
<p>
I was the one who had a few of a bit of wierder kind of books: "Basics of Electro-Magnetism", "Quantum Mechanics for Integrated Circuit Designers" and similar stuff. Those no one wanted to trade, but on the other hand my collection of sci-fi and car magazines went really well. So, when we weren't hanging out with each other, or going to get water and find some food, we would be reading books and magazines.
</p>
<p>
One week I was particularily bored, it was again one of those ceasefire/truce thingies that lasted only 4-5 days, no shelling, no need to run around or hide in basement, and it was raining. So I decided to go through my high-school and university books (I was yet to start with university in a year), and come up with a way to convert electric power into thrust force. Just like that.
</p>
<p>
At the time, in elementary school and later in high-school, I was considered to be a kind of a nerd. My friends thought I was super-smart because I didn't spend that much time doing homework and still had good grades. I told them I wasn't smart, it was really simple: you just pay attention in classes and then read through the material once before exams to refresh your memory. Ant that's it.
</p>
<p>
So, I guess my brain just stuffed a lot of more and less useful information somewhere inside itself, and when I decided to come up with a way to convert electric power into thrust force I was somehow certain that the device had to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
consist of wire coils
</li>
<li>
use an alternating or pulsating electric current
</li>
<li>
work with very high frequencies
</li>
<li>
be based on very simple principles
</li>
<li>
be shaped like Millenium Falcon
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ok, ok, I made that last one up just now. The other points were kind of "obvious" to me.
</p>
<p>
Never shy to do stupid things, I spent next, almost, a week going through my books and writing in couple of my notebooks using font size 8. Paper was kind of scarce those days. On the day 6 or 7, I had the basics laid out complete with first version of sin/cos math you can find on these pages. And I also had a headache.
</p>
<p>
That didn't bother me much, I was excited and continued to think about the "Electro-Magnetic Converter" and various technical challenges that were to be solved to get something useful: using small coils and high frequencies, handling back-EMF, powering hundreds of coils from the same generator to avoid force skewing due to frequency mismatch and a host of other things. Once I went over initial formulas and added some details in order to evaluate power-to-thrust ratio, couple of things came up:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
that ratio (power/thrust) was ginormous
</li>
<li>
heat produced by coils made out of silver, copper or gold (fantastic conductors) was ridiculous
</li>
<li>
if you use superconductors and arrange electrical elements in a certain way, you will get an interesting effect which contradicts with basic physical laws
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, the theory seems to be correct, it should work, but on the other hand it is totally not practical and in extreme cases it should be able to do the things that are not physically possible. Something was off, but I couldn't see what.
</p>
<p>
That's about where I left the whole thing and went back to the real worls to chase wind, girls from my neighbourhood, look for more interesting magazines to read and to hope with everyone else around me that the war will end soon.
</p>
<p>
3-4 years later, I remembered the EMC thingy I came up with that summer, and decided to show my notes and formulas to couple of professors from the university I was attending at the time. I told them what it was about, showed them calculations and concluded my presentation with a list of issues I have found. I just wanted them to tell me if the reasoning and the math is correct and if the whole thing was possible, at least in theory and in accordance with what we were being thaught about electricity and magnetism at the time.
</p>
<p>
After a few days we were again sitting in the office of one of the professors and they told me that everything seemed ok. Theory seems fine, math looks correct and the list of issues/potential problems is valid. They said the next step would be to build proof of concept. And they also said they had quite a bit of people come to them with various ideas and theories, but I was the first to bring them a list of potential issues and problems I noted with my own work.
</p>
<p>
I was glad that I was first at something and I was also glad that they thought the theory and math was valid. There were few more people who took a look at my notes and they said the same thing: you should do proof-of-concept thingy. If it wasn't for that ridiculously high power-to-thrust ratio I would probably do something about it. But since it didn't seem practical, it didn't look like it was going to make me a millionaire, and I was in my prime student days then, I thought it is much wiser to devote my time to chasing girls (again?), going out on Friday and Saturday night, and Tuesday, and often Wednesday, and make some student money selling bootleg cassette-tapes and, later, CDs.
</p>
<p>
And then came the Internet and then these stories about em drive this, em engine that, microwaves, kilowatts and what not. It's been more than 20 years since I first wrote these formulas. I still don't think this could amount to something useful, other than maybe as a main engine for small deep space probes.
</p>
<p>
If it works.
</p>
<p>
And that's the only thing that is still bugging me from time to time: does it work? Is the theory correct? Is it? Does it? Huh?
</p>
<p>
And also, I still think there are more important things for me to waste my time on, like building CNC machines, making some money, teasing women (when does that ever stop?), building that 14' boat with my friend and trying to make my first million with that perfect mouse trap I just invented. Ok, ok, I made that last one up just now.
</p>
<p>
So, building that proof-of-concept with a lot of wire, huge mosfets and torsion scale to measure nano-Newton forces, that will just have to wait for now.
</p>
<p>
Unless...
</p>
<p>
This could be a challenge. You could find the error in the theory or in the math, if there is one. Or build that POC. There is no award here other than you could become famous. Or rich. Or something like that. In any case it seems better than working on the best mouse trap ever.

Can you find a hidden error in this?

<p>
Or...
</p>
<p>
Can you make that space engine?

The challenge is out...
